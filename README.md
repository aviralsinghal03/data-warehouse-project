# 🏢 Modern Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Modern Data Warehouse & Analytics Project**! 🚀  
This repository showcases a complete, hands-on data engineering and analytics solution — from raw data ingestion to analytical insights — built with **MySQL**. Developed as a portfolio project, it demonstrates **best practices** in **data warehousing**, **ETL**, **data modeling**, and **SQL-based analytics**.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture** approach with the following layers:

### 🔶 Bronze Layer
- Stores **raw source data** directly from **CSV files**
- Loaded into MySQL using custom ETL scripts

### 🔷 Silver Layer
- Applies **data cleansing**, **standardization**, and **normalization**
- Transforms raw data into structured formats ready for modeling

### 🟡 Gold Layer
- Models business-ready data using a **star schema**
- Optimized for **reporting**, **analytics**, and **BI tools**
